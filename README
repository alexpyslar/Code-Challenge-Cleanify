This is a test task project.
Done by Alex Pyslar - Svitla Systems.

Everything (except Smarty) done from the scratch.
I've also made my own validation, but in general there is possibility to use Smarty validation class as well.

There is database table dump called "fields.sql" in db_dump directory.
Connection with database is configured in: app\model\resource\DbConnector.php
